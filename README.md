# Industry 4.0 Logo Generator

Simple static site that generates Industry 4.0 style logos (gear/network, chip/circuit, hex grid).

How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Pick a design, choose `Primary`, `Secondary`, and `Background` colors.
- Set size and click `Download PNG` or `Download ICO`.

Notes
- The ICO file is a minimal container that wraps a PNG image — good for favicons and quick use.
- Built with plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS — no build step required.
